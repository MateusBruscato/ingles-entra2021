                <p>
                    I've worked in the coffee area since 2019 until June of 2022.
                </p>
                <p>Since the beginning I was always aiming to work with speciallity coffee,
                    but I just got a job in the earliers of 2020, in a regular coffee shop.
                    There I could learn more about of the operation of a cafeteria, hospitality
                    and how to manage multitasking (mainly in the rush hour). However, the
                    coffee shop wasn't so focused in high quality coffee and coffee equipments. So, after this coffee shop
                    finally I got a job in another coffee shop and so I got on track of the speciallity coffee scenario.
                    Then I could start to taste a lot of different coffees and test lots of different techniques, always looking forward
                    to enhance my knowledge and also my skills in the barista profession.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was excited about growing in the speciallity coffee area, but in 2021 I started
                    to miss some of the intellectual work that I've had in Mathematics' course. So my
                    eyes started looking around for something that could supply this necessity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, it turns out that I've found the software development area and here I'm! :)
